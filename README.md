# Completed the Docker-PHP course

Following this course [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv-P_rPFw4c), I learned more about the following topics:
- Setting up a simple PHP application from scratch
- Containerizing said PHP application
- Using tools like FPM, Nginx, Redis to enhance the PHP application
- Using Docker Compose to run multiple containers at once
- Using XDebug to debug the PHP application
  - CI with Github Actions and pushing images to the Docker Hub
